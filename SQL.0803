SQL Overview:

Data manipulation, Data access, 
SQL non-procedural, declarative

DDL Definition (Create, Drop,  Truncate)
DML Manipulation (Insert, Update, delete)

Syntax, semi colon, spaces, line break/indents, letter case, commas, quotation marks

Proper syntax refers to the proper order of statement/command

Semi colon is used to end the sentence

Need 1 space for word identification

Line breaks/indent immune, can be used to organise code in readable format

commas are important, it may result in syntax error

Quotation marks " ' error and char datatype

Case insentive, recommended to capitalise commands





Null Values:

It indicates which fields are nullable, null values is an empty value; it contains no value at all, which is indicated by "NULL" in the cell/blank cell

NULL vs ZERO
Null values are not the same as zero, meaning the value here is missing

Nullable fields
When creating a table, we need to decide if each field in the table is nullable or not
Set a "NOT NULL" to indicate null values are not acceptable.

eg:
CREATE TABLE PRODUCT(
Product INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
ProductName VARCHAR(25) NOT NULL)

Sometimes null values are acceptable, some info may remain emtpy

Nulls in a table have an impact on the efficiency of the database; Even null value occupy the space






Indexes:


A look up table, improve finding of data, save time but need memory!!

create index:
"CREATE INDEX person_idx ON person (firstname)"

Query optimizer: make the most efficient way

Unique and non-unique indexes
Primary key and Foreign key

each database can have more than one index,

Indexes requires memory 
- indexed field tell the db where to look for related data when the user wants to retrieve data using an indexed value 
- loaded into the Primary memory when databae is open

if primary memory is full, extra content will go into swap disk, a sextion in harddrive where overflown data from the primary memory is stored
reduntant as it will become slow again if memory overflown

Add new data into a database, it needs to create new records





Data Definition Language:


Create, 

MySQL Datatypes
Numeric: INT, Float/doubles, Decimal/numeric(x,y)
Temporal: date, time, datetime
Strings: char, varchar, tinytext/text/longtext
Large binary: Huge values represented as bytes or text can grow to 4GB per field


Designing database schema 
Project
Task
Worker


CREATE, ALTER, DROP

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS nameofdatabase;

USE Nameofdatabase;
CREATE TABLE NameofTable (
    ColumnName1 TYPE PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    ColumnName2 TYPE ...);

ALTER TABLES
Add/Romove columns
Change an existing column definition: data type,nullability or default calues 
Add/Remove constraints

ALTER TABLE Task
  ADD COLUMN(
      ProjectID CHAR(50) NOT NULL);
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_Task_Project
      FOREIGN KEY (ProjectID)
      REFERENCES Project(ProjectID)
    
Modify the table 
ALTER TABLE name
MODIFY COLUMN FirstName Varchar(50) NOT NULL


DROP DATABASE Databasename; 

DROP TABLE TableName;

ALTER TABLE Worker
    DROP FOREIGN KEY fk_Worker_Project
    DROP COLUMN ProjectID


Bridge Table: Includes a foreign key from each table it bridges

Truncate delete the data not the table
