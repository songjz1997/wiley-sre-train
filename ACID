Transaction: a set of one or more actions that represents a single or one unit of work

ACID : not required, but for security reason need to have

Atomicity : all or nothing, cannot be partially successful
Consistency : 
Isolation : When someone is editing, the data is always locked. Two users cannot edit the data at the same time; only after one user has done, another user can edit on the latest version 
Durability : the transaction data will stay committed once it has been completed
