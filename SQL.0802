Introduction to Relational Databases:


database: a structured representation of data that can be read from and write to
DBSM: database management system, software to manage the databases; eg, MySQL, Oracle


Table: Relation, a logical grouping of data in a relational database
Columns: Attribute, define the name and type of data in database row
Rows: Record, Tuple,  A single, logical unit item in a table.

Keys:
  Primary Key: A unique column in each row, identify every row
  Foreign Key: A copy of another table's primary key to cross-related to the table


Relationships:

  One-to-one: Id to Id
  One-to-many: Id to products
  Many-to-many: customers to products
  


ACID Compliance:


Transaction: a set of one or more actions that represents a single or one unit of work

ACID : not required, but for protecting data quality reason need to have

Atomicity : all or nothing, cannot be partially successful
Consistency : make sure the data requirements always keep the same, not only for the types and sizes of data, but also for the primary key and foreign key relationships 
Isolation : When someone is editing, the data is always locked. Two users cannot edit the data at the same time; only after one user has done, another user can edit on the latest version 
Durability : the transaction data will stay committed once it has been completed

Transaction log: a history of executed actions. Ensure the database remains consistent.
Backup: data backup - large and only periodically 
        log backup - smaller
        database cluster - use multiple database servers and execute transactions on each. One fails, another takes its place
